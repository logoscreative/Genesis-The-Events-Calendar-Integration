# Genesis + The Events Calendar Integration

Using The Events Calendar (Pro) with a Genesis theme can [require additional code](https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/genesis-theme-framework-integration/). This plugin aims to ease that integration without asking people to paste code snippets into functions.php.

## Beta

I'm actively soliciting feedback on the plugin to try and test out various themes and configurations. Please file an issue or create a pull request if you see anything that needs fixing.

## Scope

As much as possible, the goal of this plugin is to be a drop-in fix for incompatibility between Genesis and The Events Calendar (Pro). 

"Features" should be considered out of scope, and UI elements should only be added as needed. Currently, the only known UI element needed would be for enabling layout selection for event templates. Please see [Issue #1](https://github.com/logoscreative/Genesis-The-Events-Calendar-Integration/issues/1).
